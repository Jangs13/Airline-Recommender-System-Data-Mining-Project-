## Project Overview

The Airline Recommender System project utilizes data mining techniques to analyze customer data and provide personalized recommendations for airlines. By understanding customer preferences, the system aims to enhance the overall customer experience and satisfaction in the airline industry.

## Features

- Customer profiling: Analyzes customer data to understand preferences, such as destination, travel class, and flight duration.
- Collaborative filtering: Recommends airlines based on similar customers' preferences and behaviors.
- Content-based filtering: Provides recommendations by matching customer preferences with airlines' features and attributes.
- Hybrid approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to generate accurate and diverse recommendations.
- Evaluation metrics: Measures the performance of the recommender system using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset sourced from [XYZ Airline Data Repository](link-to-dataset). The dataset contains anonymized customer information, including demographic data, travel history, and customer ratings.

## Installation

To run the Airline Recommender System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Airline-Recommender-System.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. [Additional installation steps or dependencies, if any]

## Usage

1. Preprocess the dataset and perform necessary feature engineering steps.

2. Train the recommender system model using the prepared dataset.

3. Deploy the trained model or use it for making recommendations.

4. [Provide additional usage instructions if needed]

## Results

[Discuss the results and findings of your project. Highlight the performance of the recommender system and its effectiveness in providing personalized recommendations.]
